# What is this course?

- An introduction to exploratory data analysis 
- (which overlaps a lot with data science and statistics)
- All the steps in the data analysis process from beginning to end 
- (instead of focusing on a particular statistical method)

--

**Q - What background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

--

**Q - Is this an intro statistics course?**  
A - The course is practical and focuses more on data analysis and visualization but we will apply many tools from statistics. 

--

**Q - Do we need to program?**   
A - Yes, we will use R instead of a point-and-click interface.
