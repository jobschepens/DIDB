## Study results

```{r message=FALSE}
mb_yawn <- read_csv("../../data/mb-yawn.csv")
```

.small[
```{r}
mb_yawn %>%
  count(group, outcome) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```
]

Difference in proportions of yawners: 

$\hat{p}_{treatment} - \hat{p}_{control} = 0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441$

---

## Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Null hypothesis
- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. $\rightarrow$ Alternative hypothesis

## Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times<sup>1</sup> to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the \red{number of face cards} (the number of people who yawned in the treatment group).

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners (treatment - control), and plot it 
on the board.

5. Mark the difference you find on the dot plot on the board.

## Simulation by hand

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` Do the simulation results suggest that yawning 
is contagious, i.e. does seeing someone yawn and yawning appear to be dependent?

## Visualizing the null distribution

.question[
`r emo::ji("bust_in_silhouette")` What would you expect the center of the 
null distribution to be?
]

--

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```

---

## Calculating the p-value, visually

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` What is the p-value, i.e. in what % of the 
simulations was the simulated difference in sample proportion at least as extreme 
as the observed difference in sample proportions?
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```

---

## Calculating the p-value, directly

```{r}
null_dist %>%
  filter(stat >= 0.0441) %>%
  summarise(p_value = n()/nrow(null_dist))

# Inference overview

## What do you want to do?

- Estimation -> Confidence interval
  - bootstrap: take x samples randomly from the sample with replication 
- Decision -> Hypothesis test
  - simulate: take x samples randomly from a theoretical distribution with replication (e.g. for testing ig a proportion is different from a given value)
  - permute: shuffle the sample and reassign (re-assign labels) for testing two proportions
- First step: Ask the following questions
  1. How many variables?
  2. What types of variables?
  3. What is the research question?

# Confidence intervals

---

## Confidence intervals

- Bootstrap
- Bounds: cutoff values for the middle XX% of the distribution
- Interpretation: We are XX% confident that the true population parameter is in the interval.
- `infer::generate(reps, type = "bootstrap")`

---

## Accuracy vs. precision

.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` What happens to the width of the confidence interval as the confidence level increases? Why? Should we always prefer a confidence interval with a higher confidence level?
]

---

## Number of observation decreases width of intervals

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
set.seed(20171107)
acs_emp <- acs12 %>% filter(employment == "employed", income > 0)
acs_10 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(10) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(5000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "median")
acs_100 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(100) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(5000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "median")
acs_500 <- acs_emp %>% sample_n(500) %>%
  specify(response = income) %>%
  generate(5000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "median")
p1 <- ggplot(acs_10, aes(x = stat)) + geom_bar() + xlim(0, 120000) + ggtitle("Sample size = 10")
p2 <- ggplot(acs_100, aes(x = stat)) + geom_bar() + xlim(0, 120000) + ggtitle("Sample size = 100")
p3 <- ggplot(acs_500, aes(x = stat)) + geom_bar() + xlim(0, 120000) + ggtitle("Sample size = 500")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
```

## Equivalency of confidence and significance levels

- Two sided alternative HT with $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $CL = 1 - \alpha$
- One sided alternative HT with $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $CL = 1 - (2 \times \alpha)$

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
normTail(U = 1.96, L = -1.96, df = 100, col = "#56B4E9", axes = FALSE)

#
normTail(U = 1.65, L = -1.65, df = 100, col = "#56B4E9", axes = FALSE)

## Interpretation of confidence intervals

`r emo::ji("bust_in_silhouette")` Which of the following is more informative:

<li> The difference in price of a liter of milk between Rewe and Aldi is 30 cents.
<li> A liter of milk costs 30 cents more at Rewe compared to Aldi.
</ul>
</div>

# Hypothesis tests

---

## Hypothesis testing

- Set the hypotheses.
- Calculate the observed sample statistic.
- Calculate the p-value.
- Make a conclusion, about the hypotheses, in context of the data and the research question.
- `infer::hypothesize(null = "point")` and 
  - `infer::generate(reps, type = "simulate")`  
  - `infer::generate(reps, type = "bootstrap")`
- `infer::hypothesize(null = "independence")` and 
  - `infer::generate(reps, type = "permute")`
  
---

## Hypothesis testing exercises

.small[
.question[
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")`
Describe the simulation process for tesing for the parameter
]]

- Note any assumptions you make in terms of sample size, observed sample statistic, etc.
- Imagine using index cards or chips to represent the data. 
- Specify whether the null hypothesis would be independence or point.
- Specify whether the simulation type would be bootstrap, simulate, or permute.

---

## Testing errors

- Type 1: Reject $H_0$ when you shouldn't have
    + P(Type 1 error) = $\alpha$
- Type 2: Fail to reject $H_0$ when you should have
    + P(Type 2 error) is harder to calculate, but increases as $\alpha$ decreases

.question[
`r emo::ji("bust_in_silhouette")` In a court of law

- Null hypothesis: Defendant is innocent
- Alternative hypothesis: Defendant is guilty

Which is worse: Type 1 or Type 2 error?
