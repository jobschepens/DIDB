## Discussion 

1. Gender (male/female) is not a quantitative variable. Can you think of any ways you could study gender in quantitative research?

2. Learning styles (e.g. visual, audio, kinaesthetic) are not a quantitative variable. Can you think of any ways you could study learning styles in quantitative research?

3. What is your worldview (epistemology) with regard to research? Do you think it is compatible with using quantitative methods?

4. Can you think of a research question you could study using quantitative methods?

5. What kind of research question would you study using a mixed methods design?
