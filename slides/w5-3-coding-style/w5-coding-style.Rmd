# Coding style

## Style guide

>"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
>
>Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/
- There's more to it than what we'll cover today, but we'll mention more as we introduce more functionality, and do a recap later in the semester

---

## File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---

## Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---

## Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls. 
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```

---

## Long lines

- Limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.
- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.

---

## Assignment

- Use `<-` not `=`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 2

# Bad
x = 2
```

---

## Quotes

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # Good
  labs(title = "`Shine bright like a diamond`",
  # Good
       x = "Diamond prices",
  # Bad
       y = 'Frequency')
```
