# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Toolkit

![toolkit](img/toolkit.png)

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## R essentials

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```
  
--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## Let's take a tour - R Markdown


.center[
![](../img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project of mine
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

## <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> `AE 02 - Bechdel`

.question[
What is the Bechdel test?
]

--

The Bechdel test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.

- Go to the [RStudio Cloud workspace](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1180772) 
- Open and knit the R Markdown document.

## Workspaces

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work 
with R Markdown: The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console!

- Run the following in the console
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```
.question[
All looks good, eh?
]

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document
```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```
.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
