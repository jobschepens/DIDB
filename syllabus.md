## Learning goals

The goal of this course is to provide an understanding and skillset to be able to carry out exploratory data analysis tasks. The course covers theoretical basics and all the steps in the data analysis process from beginning to end (instead of focusing on a particular statistical method). These steps include formulating research questions and analysis approach, importing, cleaning, visualization, statistics, and communicating. After the course, students are able to better evaluate other research findings and analyze real data themselves. The course also aims to develop interest in data analysis.  

Specifically, students will learn about:
- the complexities of data collection in terms of its limitations, bias, and how this can affect results.
- how to use R 
- introductory statistics
- applying typical analysis methods to understand patterns and make decisions about significance. 
- relationships between variables
- interpretation of results 
- critically assess quantitative claims about data
- how to perform a complete research projects based on existing data 


## Course style

Due to corona, I am expecting that the course will completely take place online. We can have regular sessions if the guidelines changes of course. We will use a platform (probably WebEx) for online seminar sessions (lectures and discussions of assignments). The idea is that these sessions have many opportunities for interaction. We will adapt the course based on the assignments. This style requires that students are able to work somewhere where they have access to a computer with internet. We will be using R instead of SPSS to do analyses. R is free and can even be run in the cloud for free so you do not have to install anything (RStudio Cloud). We will be using Moodle to host this syllabus, readings, for discussion, and getting help. It would be great when students can answer each other's questions there. Let me know if this style poses difficulties. The course is split up in two parts. The first part is focussed on getting to know R, data manipulation, and visualization. The second part focusses on statistics. The final part is about reproducible analyses. 


## Grading

This course is part of a module that will graded with a seperate Modulpruefung (z.B. Forschungsbericht 2 ECTS). To get a grade for the Modulpruefung, students also need to successfully do the coursework for two chosen module elements. Finishing this course counts as one of these two elements. This course is listed as an element 4 course, which means that this is a quantitative course (in contrast to elemenst 1 and 2) and a more advanced course than an element 3 course. The required coursework to pass the course consists of 3 assignments. There will also be a weekly additional assignments on Datacamp. Finishing at least all but one of the normal assignments and most of the Datacamp assignments will count as a finished Studienleistung. The Modulpruefung can be carried out in the context of this course and it will consist of a final project based on immigrant language testing data. 


## Policy

- Feedback is always welcome
- We will respect each other and there should be a safe learning environment for everyone. If you feel uncomfortable for any reason, contact me or the central or decentral TU Complaints Office. 


## Literature 

Reading is mainly optional throughout the course. Students who feel like they can benefit through reading are welcome to read. We will generally discuss the readings in the online sessions besides discussing the assignments. We will discuss selected chapters as listed in the schedule. The first book is a shorter version based on the second book. I will follow the first book during  lectures. Depending on the need I can upload parts of the books that are not freely available. 

- Russel Poldrack - Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century (free)
- Andy Field - An adventure in statistics the reality enigma 2016
- Andy Field - Discovering Statistics Using R 2012
- Hadley Wickham und Garrett Grolemund - R für Data Science: Daten importieren, bereinigen, umformen, modellieren und visualisieren 2020 (free)
- Jan Vanhove - Statistische Grundlagen Eine Einführung mit Beispielen aus der Sprachforschung 2018 (free)
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) 2019 (free)

Getting help 

- Post a question on Moodle
- Google (type your question or problem and add r as a keyword). Google often directly finds an answered question on the question answering website StackOverflow. 
- Share your R environment through RStudio Cloud


# Datacamp

Datacamp is an online learning environment for learning about R, data analysis, and so on. It's currently free to use for educational institutions and I think it's a great way to learn the basics of R. There are good alternatives as well (Codeacedemy, RStudio Cloud, etc.) but I have most experience with this one. Notable other courses make use of this as well (See for example https://psych10.github.io/). Datacamp automatically creates a workspace for the course participants. The courses within the data analyst career track fit best to the learning objectives of this course. The skill tracks start with topics that are a bit too advanced and the other career tracks lean to heavily on statistics or include topics that are not part of this course such as machine learning. Within the analyst track, courses 1 to 9 are a very good coverage of the learning goals for this course, 10 to 13 are too specialist, and 14 to 19 are excellent again. Some courses from the statistics track may be mixed in.
