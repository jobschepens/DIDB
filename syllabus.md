# Course information

## Coursebook details

- Master-Studiengang Erziehungswissenschaft
- Modul 4 Forschungswerkstatt (10 ECTS)
- Element 1 Methoden der empirischen Bildungsforschung (4 ECTS) 
- Study section: 2. Semester

- Teacher: Job Schepens


## Learning goals

This course is listed as an element 1 course, which means that this course focuses on methods rather than statistics. The element 2 course focuses more on statistical analysis. The course has a close relation with ongoing quantitative research at the institute. The goal of this course is to prepare students to carry out a research study that includes quantitative data analysis independently. The course provides an understanding and skillset to be able to carry out such studies. The course covers theoretical basics and all the steps in the research process from beginning to end (instead of focusing on a particular statistical method or analysis). These steps include: formulating research questions and analysis approach, importing data, visualization, statistics, and communicating. After the course, students are able to better evaluate other research findings and analyze real data themselves. The course also aims to develop interest in quantitative research. The course is called educational data science because we will learn about educational science and about working with data at the same time.  

Specifically, students will learn about:
- examples of research designs and methods 
- the complexities of data collection in terms of its limitations, bias, and how this can affect results.
- how to use R
- introductory statistics
- applying typical analysis methods to understand patterns and make decisions about significance. 
- interpretation of results 
- critically assess quantitative claims about data
- how to perform a complete research projects based on existing data 
- some introductionary statistics, multivariate analysis or other more advanced analyses are not part of this course. 

For a glimpse of what we will be doing, check out the [Detailed schedule](https://jobschepens.github.io/EW-M7E4/detailedschedule.html) of the exploratory data analysis course taught last semester by me. 


## Course style

Due to corona, the course will completely take place online. We will use Zoom for online seminar sessions (lectures and discussions of assignments). The idea is that these sessions have many opportunities for interaction. We will adapt the course based on the assignments. This style requires that students are able to work somewhere where they have access to a computer with internet. 

We will be using R instead of SPSS to do explore datasets (without statistics). R is free and can even be run in the cloud for free so you do not have to install anything (RStudio Cloud). We will be using Moodle to host this syllabus, readings, for discussion, and getting help. It would be great when students can answer each other's questions there. Let me know if this style poses difficulties. The course is split up in two parts. The first part is focussed on getting to know R, data manipulation, and visualization. The second part focusses on statistics.


## Grading

This course is part of a module that will be graded with a seperate Modulpruefung (z.B. Forschungsbericht 2 ECTS). To get a grade for the Modulpruefung, students also need to successfully do the coursework for the two module elements. Finishing this course counts as one of these two elements. The required coursework to pass this course consists of several assignments. Finishing at least all but one of the assignments will count as a finished Studienleistung. The Modulpruefung can be carried out in the context of this course and it will consist of a final project based on immigrant language testing data. 


## Policy

- Feedback is always welcome
- We will respect each other and there should be a safe learning environment for everyone. If you feel uncomfortable for any reason, contact me or the central or decentral TU Complaints Office. 


# Learning resources

There are many resources to learn how to do educational data science. Everyone has their own learning style so we will use various learning resources such as quizzes, tutorials, small group discussions, and assignments. I will provide links to these resources as we go along. 


## Literature 

Reading is mainly optional throughout the course. Students who feel like they can benefit through reading are welcome to read. We will generally discuss the readings in the online sessions besides discussing tutorials and assignments. We will discuss selected chapters as listed in the schedule. The first book follows the structure of the second book but is much shorter. I will largely follow the first book during lectures. Depending on the need I can upload parts of the books that are not freely available.
