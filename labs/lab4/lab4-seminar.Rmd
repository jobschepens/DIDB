## Introduction

```{r fig.margin=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# include_graphics("img/whickham.png")
```

A study conducted in Whickham, England recorded participants' age, smoking status at baseline, and then 20 years later recorded their health outcome.

# Packages

In this lab we will work with the `tidyverse` and `mosaicData` packages.

This is the first time we're using the `mosaicData` package, you need to make 
sure to install it first by running `install.packages("mosaicData")` in the 
console.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(mosaicData) 
```

Note that these packages are also loaded in your R Markdown document.


# The data

The data is in the `mosaicData` package. You can load it with

```{r load-data}
data(Whickham)
```

Take a peek at the codebook with

```{r eval=FALSE}
?Whickham
```

or at https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mosaicData/versions/0.14.0/topics/Whickham.


# Exercises

1. What type of study do you think these data comne from: observational 
   or experiment? Why?

```{r}
glimpse(Whickham)
```

2. How many observations are in this dataset? What does each observation 
   represent?


3. How many variables are in this dataset? What type of variable is each? 
   Display each variable using an appropriate visualization.
   
```{r}
Whickham %>% ggplot(aes(outcome)) + 
  geom_bar()
Whickham %>% ggplot(aes(smoker, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
Whickham %>% ggplot(aes(age, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


4. What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and 
   health outcome to be?

5. Create a visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status 
   and health outcome. Briefly describe the relationship, and evaluate whether 
   this meets your expectations. Additionally, calculate the relevant
   conditional probabilities to help your narrative. Here is some code to 
   get you started:

```{r}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, outcome) %>% 
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  mutate(n_rel = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = n_rel, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_col()
```

6. Create a new variable called `age_cat` using the following scheme:

- `age <= 44 ~ "18-44"`
- `age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64"`
- `age > 64 ~ "65+"`

```{r}
Whickham <- Whickham %>% mutate(age_cat = case_when(
  age <= 44 ~ "18-44",
  age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64",
  age > 64 ~ "65+")) 
glimpse(Whickham)
```


7. Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking 
status and health outcome, faceted by `age_cat`. What changed? What might 
explain this change? Extend the contingency table from earlier by 
breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative.

```{r}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome) %>% 
  group_by(smoker, age_cat) %>%
  mutate(n_rel = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = n_rel, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(age_cat))
```
